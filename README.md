# 💊 Drug Price Variability Analysis & Market Intelligence

A healthcare data analytics project that investigates the root causes of prescription drug price variation across the U.S., leveraging manual web scraping, Google Gemini-powered OCR extraction, and advanced data analysis techniques. 

This project identifies **pricing disparities** for 15 high-impact medications across **pharmacies** and **ZIP codes**, with a particular emphasis on **Type 2 Diabetes** treatments. The goal is to support healthcare transparency initiatives and enable smarter pharmaceutical policy and purchasing decisions.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Prescription drug prices in the U.S. are notoriously inconsistent. Even within a single ZIP code, two pharmacies may charge drastically different prices for the same medication. This project answers:

> 💡 **What drives drug price variability more — geographic location or pharmacy choice?**

To explore this, we:
- Collected pharmacy pricing data for 15 top-selling and clinically significant medications.
- Used GenAI (Gemini Flash 2.0) to extract structured pricing data from screenshots.
- Performed pharmacy-level and region-level statistical analysis.
- Outlined a data model for a future interactive dashboard.

## 📦 Dataset Creation

### ✅ Drug Selection Criteria
Selected 15 high-impact drugs by analyzing:
- **AARP Top Drugs by U.S. Spending**
- **PharmaShots Prescription Revenue Rankings**
- **Drug Discovery Trends Blockbusters**

These drugs include:  
**Semaglutide, Tirzepatide, Dulaglutide, Empagliflozin, Dapagliflozin, Insulin Glargine, Sitagliptin**, and more.

> Over 50% of the selected drugs treat **Type 2 Diabetes** and **obesity-related conditions**, driven by prevalence, chronic nature, limited generics, and media attention.

### 🖼️ Manual Data Collection (Scraping via Screenshots)

- Captured **150+ screenshots** from **GoodRx.com** across 5 ZIP codes:
  - `10001` (NYC), `30301` (Atlanta), `60601` (Chicago), `77001` (Houston), `90001` (Los Angeles)
- Screenshots organized per drug in the `goodrx_screenshots/` folder

---

### 🤖 Structured Data Extraction using GenAI

- Screenshots processed using **Google Gemini Flash 2.0**
- Extracted pharmacy names, ZIP codes, price, drug names
- Post-processed and normalized with custom Python scripts
- Final datasets:
  - `goodrx_full_output.xlsx` – raw extraction  
  - `goodrx_clean_output.xlsx` – cleaned, structured for analysis

---

## 📊 Analytical Workflow

Performed exploratory and statistical analysis using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib/Seaborn**:

- ✅ Calculated average and standard deviation per drug, pharmacy, and ZIP
- 📉 Identified **price outliers** using Z-score normalization
- 🏷️ Grouped by drug categories and region for insight clustering
- 📈 Drafted schema for Power BI dashboard with dynamic filters

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Pharmacy choice** (e.g., Walmart vs. Walgreens) affects price more than ZIP code.
- **Diabetes drugs** have the widest pricing variation — driven by brand protection, supply chain concentration, and lack of generics.
- In some ZIPs, independent pharmacies were cheaper than national chains.
- Urban areas did not consistently offer better affordability.

## 📊 Optional Power BI Dashboard (Design-Ready)

> Although the dashboard isn’t built in this repo, the analysis outlines a relational model with key metrics like:
- **Average price per ZIP**
- **Price disparity index**
- **Outlier pharmacy flags**
- Filters by drug, ZIP, and chain

---

## 💼 Skills Demonstrated

- 📌 **Data Collection** (Manual scraping strategy via screenshots)
- 🧠 **AI Integration** (OCR extraction via Gemini Flash 2.0)
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Normalization** (Excel + Python pipeline)
- 📊 **Statistical Analysis** (Z-score, descriptive stats)
- 📈 **Visualization + Reporting** (Matplotlib, Power BI schema)
- 🩺 **Domain Relevance** (Healthcare affordability + policy insight)
